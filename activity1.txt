Hi, My name is Terrence Skyler Abril, I'm a first year BSIT Student from DLL
Section 1A

This is my first file in REPO.

I'm 18 years old, Male, I graduated at MIIS under the strand of EIM, NCII qualified taken in (TESDA)Tarlac.

About me.:
From Brgy. Dalahican, I like reading, troubleshooting, and configuring mods for my own preference on my favorite game Stardew Valley.
I originally planned to take Electrical Engineering, but i was facinated by how just lines of codes are able to create something from nothing.
